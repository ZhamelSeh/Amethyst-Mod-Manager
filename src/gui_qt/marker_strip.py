"""Marker scrollbar — a QScrollBar that paints coloured conflict-highlight ticks
directly into its own track, mirroring the Tk app's combined scrollbar+marker
canvas. Used by both the modlist and the plugins panel.

We subclass QScrollBar (rather than overlay a separate widget) because a sibling
overlay parented to the view doesn't composite reliably over the scrollbar — by
owning the scrollbar's paintEvent the ticks are guaranteed to render, in the real
scrollbar track, behind the handle (exactly MO2/Tk behaviour).

Ticks: orange = anchor (the mod/plugin selected in the other panel), green = rows
the selection beats, red = rows that beat the selection. Positions are
proportional to row index so they line up with the visible scroll position.
